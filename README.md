This file explains our doubts on codifying some classes of our ontology.//
PREMISE: 
we have to deal with different kinds of quality indicators for hospitals. 
Each indicator can be assigned to a color coded value which visually identify the quality level of the hospital performance.
Indicators can be for example: number of procedures.., proportion of.., days after..
DOUBTS:
do we have to build classes which the diffrent types of indicators map to?
do we have to build a class for the color indicator? (actually this would have a role only in a visulized environment, 
something which is not the main goal of the project).
