Notes on the Updated_ontology  
Doubts return:  
We applied the changes suggested, in particular, placed each "Procedure" under different types of indicators and not under "Clinical Areas".  
A problem rises, which was there from the beginning: doing in this way, which is fine for everything else, conflicts when the same procedure has more than one indicator. In this case, we cannot have the same procedure in two different types of indicators.  
How to solve? Going back to the previous allocations for this specific case?
